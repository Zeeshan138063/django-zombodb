django-zombodb documentation
============================

Easy Django integration with Elasticsearch through `ZomboDB <https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb>`_ Postgres Extension.
Thanks to ZomboDB, **your Django models are synced with Elasticsearch after every transaction**! Searching is also very simple: you can make
Elasticsearch queries by just calling one of the search methods on your querysets. Couldn't be easier!
